## Vibecode Configuration

This project is configured for the Vibecode platform. When modifying locally, preserve these settings:

### Critical Files (DO NOT REMOVE)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/src/index.ts` line 1 | `import "@vibecodeapp/proxy"` - Required for Vibecode proxy |
| `.claude/rules/api-patterns.md` | API contract patterns for backend/frontend communication |
| `backend/CLAUDE.md` | Backend development instructions |
| `backend/scripts/start` | Vibecode-compatible startup script |
| `backend/scripts/env.sh` | Environment configuration |

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are managed by Vibecode:

- `VITE_BACKEND_URL` - Backend API URL (auto-configured)
- `BACKEND_URL` - Backend URL for server-side use
- `PORT` - Backend server port (default: 3000)
- `ENVIRONMENT` - `development` or `production`
- `VIBECODE_PROJECT_ID` - Project identifier (auto-set)

### CORS Configuration

The backend CORS is configured to allow:
- `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` (local development)
- `https://*.dev.vibecode.run` (Vibecode preview)
- `https://*.vibecode.run` (Vibecode production)

Do not modify the CORS configuration in `backend/src/index.ts` unless you understand the implications.

### Deployment

To deploy, click the **Deploy** button on vibecode.dev. The platform handles:
- Building the frontend (`bun run build`)
- Starting the backend (`scripts/start`)
- Database migrations (if Prisma is configured)
- SSL certificates and domain routing

### Adding Database/Auth

If you need persistent storage or user authentication, use the `database-auth` skill in Vibecode. This will:
- Add Prisma ORM with SQLite
- Add Better Auth for user authentication
- Update the backend configuration automatically
