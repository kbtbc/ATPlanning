# AT Thru-Hike Planner - Quick Start

## The Basics

Three tabs. One trail. Everything syncs by mile marker.

## Planner Tab

1. Set your **starting mile** (or tap GPS)
2. Choose your **direction** (NOBO or SOBO)
3. Slide **miles per day** (8-25) and **days ahead** (1-14)
4. Scroll through your **day-by-day itinerary** with shelters, resupply, and features
5. Tap any day to expand it. Tap "Set as start" on any location to re-plan from there.
6. The **elevation profile** below shows the terrain with markers for shelters (green), resupply (orange), and features (gray)

## Resupply Tab

1. See every resupply point ahead of you, sorted by distance
2. **Color badges** tell you the quality: Major Town (full services), Trail Town (good), On Trail (convenience), Limited (plan ahead)
3. Tap any location to see the **full business directory** (891 businesses across 112 stops)
4. Filter by **Lodging, Food, Shuttles, or Services**
5. Tap phone numbers to call. Tap addresses to open Google Maps.

## Weather Tab

1. Type a **mile number** or **shelter name** in the search bar, or tap **GPS**
2. Temperatures are **elevation-adjusted** (accounts for valley station vs. ridge)
3. **Current conditions** up top: temp, feels-like, wind, rain, UV
4. **Hourly scroll** for the next 24 hours
5. **7-day forecast** below with temp bars, rain %, wind, UV

## Quick Tips

- Your mile position **syncs across all tabs** — switch freely
- **Dark mode**: toggle with the sun/moon icon in the header
- **Trail Stats**: tap in the footer for mileage by state
- Weather **refresh** button updates data for the same location. Switching locations auto-fetches.
- Direction convention: NOBO = East is RIGHT, West is LEFT off-trail
