3. **Scroll down** - Hourly cards for the next 24 hrs, then a 7-day outlook

## What You're Looking At

- **7-Day rows** - Colored temp bar (blue=cold, red=hot), rain %, wind, UV, feels-like range

## Key Things to Know

- **Temps are elevation-adjusted.** The forecast accounts for the difference between valley weather stations and your ridge. The adjustment is shown in the info banner.
- **Wind format:** "12 mph NW" is steady. "12/35 mph/gusts NW" means steady 12, gusts to 35.
- **UV labels:** Low (0-2), Moderate (3-5), High (6-7), Very High (8-10), Extreme (11+)
- **All times are Eastern.**

## Pro Tips

- Look ahead: check the weather at tonight's camp, not where you are now
- "Feels like" matters more than actual temp on windy ridges
- Use the 7-day view to plan big-mile days around good weather
